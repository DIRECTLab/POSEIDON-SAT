# POSEIDON

This fork of the POSEIDON data augmentation tool, described by P. Ruiz-Ponce, D. Ortez-Perez, J. Garcia-Rodriguez, and B. Kiefer (2023) in [POSEIDON: A Data Augmentation Tool for Small Object Detection Datasets in Maritime Environments](https://doi.org/10.3390/s23073691); is modified to augment the [ShipRSImageNet](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3104230) dataset published by Z. Zhang, L. Zhang, Y. Wang, P. Feng and R. He.

The ShipRSImageNet dataset is avaialble in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zzndream/ShipRSImageNet) published by the authors. As the
ShipRSImageNet dataset is licensed for only academic use, an augmented dataset using this tool is subject to the same license. See the GitHub repository for the ShipRSImageNet dataset for more information.

The [ShipRSImageNet devkit](https://github.com/zzndream/ShipRSImageNet_devkit) is useful for exploring the dataset, as are the various functions inside the `poseidon/shiprsimagenet.py` file.
